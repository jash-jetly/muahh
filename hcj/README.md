## 🌃 About

**Night Vigil** is a 3D action game playable directly in the browser. You play as a masked vigilante patrolling a procedurally generated noir cityscape at night — grappling between rooftops, gliding across streets, and taking down criminals in fluid combat.

Every single visual element — buildings, enemies, props, lighting — is rendered using **Three.js geometry and materials only**. No image assets exist. The entire world is math.

> 💀 **The Joker has planted explosive devices across the city's rooftops.**
> His thugs guard each bomb. Time is running out.
> Use your detective vision to locate threats and disarm every bomb before the city falls.

## 🎨 Visual Philosophy

Night Vigil deliberately avoids textures and image assets. The entire aesthetic is achieved through:

- **Primitive geometry** — cubes, cylinders, spheres, cones, capsules
- **Material colors** — a palette of blacks, midnight blues, dim purples, and soft neon accents
- **Lighting** — moonlight, ambient city glow, hemisphere lighting, and accent point lights
- **Fog** — exponential distance fog for atmospheric depth
- **Shadows** — PCF soft shadow mapping for grounded realism

The result is a stylized, minimalist noir cityscape that runs at **60 FPS**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **HTML5** | Structure & HUD |
| **CSS3** | UI styling, animations, screen transitions |
| **Vanilla JavaScript** | All game logic — zero frameworks |
| **Three.js r128** | WebGL rendering, geometry, lighting, shadows |

No React. No Vue. No Node. No build step. Just the browser.

## 📊 Performance

- Target: **60 FPS** on modern browsers
- Optimized geometry with `PCFSoftShadowMap`
- `ACESFilmicToneMapping` for cinematic color grading
- Pixel ratio capped at `2x` for high-DPI displays
- Exponential fog culls distant geometry visually
